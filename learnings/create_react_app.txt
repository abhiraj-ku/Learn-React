what is create-react-app

Create React App (CRA) is a command-line interface tool that automates the creation of a new React application. 
It is an officially supported tool by the React team and provides a streamlined way to set up a new React project
without having to configure complex build tools like webpack and Babel.

Create React App sets up a development environment with all the necessary tools to get started building React applications. 
It includes a pre-configured development server, a build process to optimize and bundle your code for production,
 and a number of other helpful features such as hot reloading for faster development.

With Create React App, developers can quickly bootstrap a new React project with the latest best practices 
and focus on writing code instead of configuring build tools. It's an excellent starting point for new React projects 
and is used by many developers and organizations as the foundation for their web applications.

In React, an element is the smallest building block of a React application. 
It is an immutable description of what should appear on the screen, 
and it defines the structure and properties of a user interface component. 
Elements are lightweight, and multiple elements can be combined to form a more complex user interface.

An element in React is represented as a plain JavaScript object that describes the component's properties (props),
 its children, and the type of component to render. 
 The type of component can be either a built-in HTML element such as "div" or "span",
  or a user-defined component created by a developer.
